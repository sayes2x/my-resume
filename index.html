    <h3>Front-End Developer Training</h3>
    <h4>June 2017 - Present</h4>
    <p>I am aggressively studying to become a front-end developer with the goal to become a full-stack developer. Using resources such as
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"><em>freeCodeCamp</em></a>,

    <div>
    <h3>Twitch TV Viewer</h3>
    <p>Displays the status of 8 Twitch channels. Combines two API calls into one JavaScript object to build the HTML to display Twitch channel information. Features a search box to filter the channels by name, and three filter switches to display all channels,
      online channels, or offline channels. Uses jQuery to make API calls, animate the page, and navigate the DOM.</p>
    <h3>Wikipedia Viewer</h3>
    <p>Using the Wikipedia API, displays search results that link to Wikipedia articles as text is entered in a search box. Makes extensive use of the CSS transition property to smoothly animate changes. API calls for this web page made using jQuery.</p>
    <h3>Local Weather Viewer</h3>
    <p>Using the browser geolocation API, this web page retrieves weather information via an API call to https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/. Clicking on the temperature will alternate between fahrenheit and centigrade. I used Google Fonts to get the font,
      Montserrat. The API call is made using vanilla JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>Personal Portfolio</h3>
    <p>I built this project as an assignment for freeCodeCamp. The goal of this assignment was to create a personal portfolio web page. It was designed to be a one page website, where all of the content could be navigated by scrolling or clicking links in
      the navigation bar at the top. Designed to resize to be viewable on any sized device, the site uses flexbox to layout the home, about and contact sections and CSS grid to layout the portfolio section, which provides access to several other of my
      projects, and access to my social media content. This project uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 3.</p>
    <h3>Product Landing Page</h3>
    <p>I created a demo product landing page using just HTML and CSS. I decided not to use Bootstrap in this assignment. The navigation bar uses flexbox. I have a blog post here [https://codepen.io/sayes2x/post/making-a-flexbox-wrap-at-a-specific-place]
      about how I used flexbox and a media query to get the navigation bar to break into two rows at the right place on smaller screens. This webpage features an embedded YouTube video. Here {https://codepen.io/sayes2x/post/dynamically-resizing-a-youtube-video}
      is a blog post describing how I found a simple way to get the video to resize appropriately for smaller screens. You can navigate this web page by scrolling or by clicking the links in the header. The form at the bottom for submitting your email
      does not do anything at this point but sends you to the assignment page for this project at freeCodeCamp.org.</p>
    <h3>Random Quote Generator</h3>
    <p>The Random Quote Generator web page uses an API call to get a quote to display. Clicking the new quote button will get another quote to display. Clicking the Twitter button will allow you to tweet the quote. The colors of the web page randomly change
      each time the quote changes including when the page loads. I used Font Awesome for the “quote” and Twitter icons and grabbed the font, Montserrat, from Google Fonts. The API call is made using vanilla JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>Survey Form</h3>
    <p>This assignment is an exercise in using HTML form elements. Using only HTML and CSS, this web page features input fields, drop down options fields, radio boxes, check boxes, and a text area. All form elements are labeled and the input fields have
      placeholder text to help describe the purpose of the field. The input fields use HTML5 validation. The submit button just clears the form if all the validation tests are passed.</p>
    <h3>Technical Documentation Page</h3>
    <p>This project is a web page with documentation for JavaScript. It features a main section that contains the documentation and a navigation section. On large screens the navigation section is on the left. On smaller screens it is at the top of the page.</p>
    <h3>Tribute Page</h3>
    <p>This web page is a tribute page for Samuel Morse. It includes images, text, and links to external websites. This project was created with HTML and Bootstrap 3. The web page is designed to be responsive to the size of the screen. The images will resize
      and change their position depending on the screen size. I used the Bootstrap grid to create whitespace around the paragraphs on larger screens, and also created a carousel using Bootstrap. There is only one line of CSS to give the web page a top
      margin.</p>
